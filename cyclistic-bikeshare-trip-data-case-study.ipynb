Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. \n\nFrom these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. The data consists of 12 CSV files each detailing one month of trip data from August 2020 - July 2021.\n\nThe datasets are located in the company's cloud server, and so we must download it to prepare, process and analyze. Each dataset consists of 13 columns, including: ride id, ride type, start time/end time, start station name, start station id, end station name, end station id, starting latitude/longitude, ending latitude/longitude, and member or casual rider.\n\nAs the data is public data, we will assume it is reliable. We can verify the data's integrity by ensuring that it is clean, up-to-date, and stored in one centralized location\n\n\n### Tools\n\n For this project, I have decided to use R  to merge, clean, and analyze the datasets. It can handle wrangling the large dataset, analysis functions, and options to visualize, I feel like this is the best choice.
